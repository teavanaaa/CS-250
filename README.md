How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  It is imperative to interpret user needs when creating a program. The user is the most essential part of any program. Without them, there is no need for a program at all. This is why meeting face-to-face with the customer is so important. I ask as many questions as possible and ensure I understand what they are looking for. Creating user stories helps with this because they are written from the user's perspective. This also helps the team to understand what the user is looking for so they can implement it into every aspect of what they do. The user should be at the center of every decision. 




How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  I approach developing programs by planning. Planning out what needs to be done in what timeframe is crucial. I definitely plan to incorporate sprint planning into my future development work.
  
I try to use the most straightforward code possible for every aspect of the program; this keeps it readable and maintainable for future changes or updates. 
	
  I think software tools such as Jira will be paramount for future, more extensive projects in a team setting. As well as other methods such as Kanban boards, burndown charts, scrum events, etc. Scrum is a powerful agile method that helps teams produce a high-quality product in a short amount of time. I want to do this kind of work in the future. 
	
	
	

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  In a software development team, communication is critical. There is a lot of opportunity for miscommunication; two people working on the same portion of a project unknowingly, one or several people misinterpreting the program's requirements, missing a deadline notice, etc. There are hundreds of things that could go wrong without communication.
  
   Being a good team member means talking to everyone on the team, informing them of your intentions each day, what you have completed, if you need assistance, or if anything is getting in the way of your progress. A good team member respects everyone on the team and completes their work as efficiently as possible.
